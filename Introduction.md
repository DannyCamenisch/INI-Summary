# Introduction
The human brain is on average 1.5kg and has 1.2l volume. This is large, but by fare not the largest brain compared to other animals.

The main function of the [[Brain]] is to receive stimuli from the environment, encode it, do sensory integration and finally decode to make movements, actions and decisions. 

## How is information processed in the brain?
Information processing can be viewed at on many levels, from the highest to the lowest level:

behaviour -> system and pathways -> circuits -> [[Neurons]] -> microcircuits -> [[Synapses]] -> membrane potential

In a way we can compare a brain to a computer, but there are also some significant differences:

| Similar               | Different                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| process information   | massive parallelism                 |
| logical operations    | separation of memory and processing |
| memory                | constantly adapting                 |
| uses digital signals  | chemical signaling                  |
| can learn from inputs | unreliable units                    |
| consumes energy       | analog computation                  |
| ...                   | robust to damage                    |
|                       | very energy efficient               |
|                       | ...                                 |

<sup><sub>Under different we listed things that the brain has / can do but a computer doesn't.</sub></sup>

Things that are easy to us humans can be hard to a computer, mostly because we don't know how to simulate a brain. And we don't know precisely how we do things - we can do things without consciously thinking about them.
- It is relatively easy to program a computer to play chess better than a human
- We have the neuron diagram of a worm, but we still have know idea how it works

## Other facts
- WindowsXP contains more code (1.5 Gb) than human DNA (750 Mb)
- An 83000-Processor supercomputer can only match 1% of the human brain
- Deep Neural Networks were inspired by the brain at the start, but it is not how the brain works.
