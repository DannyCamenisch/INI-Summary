# The Neural Code
We want to have a look at how information is encoded in the brain. When considering a code, it is important to think about three elements:
- Correspondence - a code is a correspondence between two domains, e.g. visual signals and spike trains
- Representation - how is a code represented
- Causality - a code needs to be a causal relation

We want to learn how to encode a stimulus - how does the pattern of response look like - and how to decode - what does the response tell us about the stimulus.

To understand neuronal responses, one often measures neuronal activity, depending on a parameter of the stimulus. Example:

![[direction_encoding_cat.png]]

We have seen many different examples of encoding, one of the most interesting ones was about the encoding of space via hippocampal place cells in rats.

What one can see here is how different neurons are active, when the rat is in a specific position.

## Rate Code vs Temporal Code
**Rate coding** refers to information being carried by the firing rate. It is often argues that ***firing rate captures essentially all relevant information***.

**Temporal coding** on the other hand may refer to several quite different ideas: 
1. much of the information may be transmitted by a neuron during certain small intervals of time (phase)
2. synchronous, or what one could call quasi-synchronous, firing of neurons within and across ensembles may carry important information (synchrony)
3. the precise timing, or pattern, of spikes may carry information (time to first spike)

Often information that one sees in one encoding, can also be seen in the other encoding.

## How to investigate the stimulus encoding
We want to find out how we can model a relation of the stimulus to the firing rate of a neuron.

We have to consider that there are many factors like noise or recurrent / network effects, that make it almost impossible to find an accurate relation.

### Linear Temporal Filter
The simplest possible relation is a so called linear temporal filter given by:
$$r(t) = \sum_{k = 0}^n s_{t-k}f_k$$
Examples:
- running average filter - average over last n time points
- leaky average filter - average over last n time points where recent time points are weighted more

### Linear Spatial Filter
Another possible relation is a linear spatial filter (e.g. visual signals):
$$r(t) = \sum_{x' = 0, y'=0}^n s_{x-x', y-y'} f_{x', y'}$$
Clearly we can combine these two types of filters into one.

### Nonlinearity
We have some problems, spike rates can't be negative, spike rates can't increase indefinitely, etc. Therefore we have to combine this linear filter with a sigmoid function.

## Population Activity
Normally this linear filter and nonlinear sigmoid function are not known. We only now the high-dimensional data that results in a low-dimensional neuronal firing. We therefore are interested in how a whole population of neurons behave. (Nowadays a single probe can record the activity of up to 1'000'000 neurons)

>Population coding refers to information available from an ensemble of neurons.

### Finding the mean population response vector
We measure the spiking activity given by combination of features.

![[population_response_vector.png]]

The blue vector is then the so called response vector, with this we can project a stimuli in the direction of neuronal response.

### Finding the I/O function
The I/O function is given by:
$$P(\text{spike} | \text{stimulus}) = P(\text{spike}|s_1)$$
which can be found from data using the Bayes rule.
