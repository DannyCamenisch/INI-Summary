# Synapses
Synapses are the connection between neurons. They convert the electrical signal (action potential) coming from the axons into a **chemical signal** (neurotransmitter), that is transported to the next neuron, where it again is converted into an electrical signal (excitatory or inhibitory).

Contrary to electrical transmission multiple steps are required to release transmitter chemicals and for them to act on postsynaptic receptors, resulting in a ***time delay*** (can be as short as 0.2ms, from Ca2+ entry to secretion). Synapses are ***highly modulatable*** as it involves many different steps at the presynaptic / postsynaptic terminal.

Synapses do not always connect to dendrites, they may also connect to other axons or the the soma of another cell.

Synapses are not reliable, sometimes they may not transmit a signal or they might spontaneously transmit. 

## Steps to chemical synaptic transmission
- reaching of activation threshold of the presynaptic neuron
- conduct down the axon
- opening of voltage gated Ca channels
- diffusion and action of Ca2+ at release site
- exocytosis and diffusion of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft
- activation of postsynaptic receptors

## Neurotransmitter
Neurotransmitter are small molecules or peptides released by the Ca2+ dependent depolarization at the presynaptic terminal. 
The mechanisms and sites of synthesis are different for the two types of neurotransmitters:
- small molecule transmitters are synthesized at terminals, packaged into small clear-core vesicles
- peptides, or neuropeptides are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the synapse, sometimes they are processed along the way. Neuropeptides are packaged in large dense-core vesicles

Notice that neurotransmitter are always released in discrete packages / quanta, depending on the vesicles. 
The number of readily releasable vesicles a synapse has available is variable. A consequence of having a limited number is depletion at high stimulus frequency.

## Standard Katz (Quantal) Model of Synaptic Transmission
- One packet of neurotransmitter = 1 quantum
- action potential transiently increases in the probability of releasing nx quanta
- several quanta are available to be released
- each quanta approximately gives the same postsynaptic response
- average number of quanta released = (number of quanta available) x (average release probability)

Quantal release follows a binomial distribution.

The synaptic vesicle release consists of three principle steps:
- Docking - Docked vesicles lie close to plasma membrane (within 30 nm)
- Priming - Primed vesicles can be induced to fuse with the plasma membrane by sustained depolarization, high K+, elevated Ca++, hypertonic sucrose treatment
- Fusion - Vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release transmitter. Physiologically this occurs near calcium channels.
