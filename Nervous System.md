# Nervous System
The human nervous system consists of two part:
- Central nervous system (CNS) - [[Brain]] and spinal cord
- Peripheral nervous system (PNS)

The peripheral nervous system can be subdivided into somatic and automatic NS. Where the automatic NS again can be divided into sympathetic NS (fight and flight reactions) and parasympathetic NS (rest and digest).

The cranial nerves are the gate between the sensory periphery and our brain. They emerge directly from our brain and connect it to our primary senses (taste, smell, etc.).
