# Brain
The brain is the main part of the CNS, it is protected by the skull and the meninges. When studying brains, scientists often use mouse brains (70 million [[Neurons]]) instead of human brains.

## Anatomy
When comparing brain weight to body weight across different species, we can see a clear correlation.

### Navigating the CNS
When talking about the CNS, we saw many different definitions of orientation. The main ones are the coronal (front), sagittal (side) and the horizontal plane cut. Further definitions can be seen in the following graphic:

### Skull
The skull is a hard, protective layer around most parts of our brain. It consists of 32 bones and provides fixed points for our senses (eyes, ears, etc.).

### Meninges
The meninges is a protective layer between the skull and the brain. It consists of three membranes (inwards):
- dura mater - thick layer that gives physical protection
- arachnoid mater - cushion like layer that is fluid resistant
- pia mater - soft tissue that follows the brain structure and is also fluid resistant, so the cerebral spinal fluid can't leak out.
They are known for protecting the brain against infections.

### Ventricular System
The brain has four main cavities filled with Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF), we call the the ventricles. This CSF makes the brain float, so the brain does not touch the bones and thereby damages itself. Further it provides nutrition and an ionic environment for the brain. 

### Major divisions of the brain

The telencephalon (or cerebrum) is the part we are most interested in. This is also one of the key features of human brains, that the telencephalon is really large.

We will especially look at part of the telencephalon and the diencephalon.

### Cerebral Cortex (telencephalon)
There are four lobes in each hemisphere, they are separated by fissures in the cortex.
The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of neural tissue of the telencephalon. It mostly consists of the six-layered neocortex. We can differentiate different areas of the cortex and associate them with different functions (there are 52 areas). We call connections from the deep layers to the superficial layers feedback connections and feedforward connections the other way around.

### Neocortex (telencephalon)
Has six layers, that are not of uniform depth around the brain. The deeper we go the more cell bodies we encounter. The deepest layer contains white matter. 

### Basal ganglia (telencephalon)
Is involved in movement actions, it triggers movements but not the fine movement control. Regulates voluntary movements. Movement disorders like Parkinson's originate from here.

### Limbic system (telencephalon)
The limbic system is part of the brain that is involved in the emotional expression and memory acquisition. Especially parts like the amygdala are connected to special emotions, in this case fear. 

### Thalamus (diencephalon)
Entryway to the cortex, most signals are transmitted through the thalamus. It works as a relay station.

### Hypothalamus (diencephalon)
Below the thalamus, connects the [[Nervous System]] to the hormone system. Controls the pituitary gland, responsible for hunger, body temperature, etc.

### Cerebellum (metencaphalon)
"Little brain", coordinates motor behaviour, posture adjustments and stores memories for simple learned motor responses.

### White matter and grey matter
The white matter mostly consists of myelinated axons and is used to connect the brain (areas of grey matter). The myelin acts as an insulator and allows signals to propagate faster. 

Grey matter on the other hand consists mostly of neurons with dendrites and unmyelinated axons. This is where the actual processing happens.
