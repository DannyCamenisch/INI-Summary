# Neuromorphic Engineering
The term neuromorphic was coined by Carver Mead in the late â€™80s to describe VLSI systems containing electronic analog/digital circuits that exploit the physics of silicon to reproduce the bio-physics of neural circuits present in the nervous system.

We can characterize the goal of neuromorphic engineering in two main goal:
- understand the computational properties of biological neural systems using CMOS VLSI technology
- exploit the known properties of biological systems to design and implement efficient devices

## Neuromorphic computing
Neuromorphic computing is a radical paradigm shift:

## Neuromorphic electronic circuits
These circuits use transistors in their analog domain (discrete) to emulate the ion channels. If the transistor is operated in sub-threshold areas, the gate voltage has to be increased. Remember the transistor types:
- p-FET - will conduct with no voltage applied
- n-FET - will conduct when voltage is applied

In the lecture it was showed how we can build some basic circuits.
